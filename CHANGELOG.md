# Changelog

## v0.3.2

### Modified
- **Team bubbles**: simplified to trigger only from server-delivered `(Team Name) Player: message` lines, including the local player's own messages. No join detection, team-color comparison, or scoreboard membership checks. Global, party, private, system and hub messages remain excluded. The 2-second per-sender cooldown remains.

### Fixed
- Team chat detection now uses explicit `(Team Name) Playername:` format exclusively.
- Join messages and name-color matching removed from bubble eligibility.
- Own team-chat messages now produce visible bubbles in third-person view.
